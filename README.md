## About

This unity simulation was part of a university research project. It aimed to explore enhancing tourists' sense of place with an autonomous shuttle bus. The research question posed was: “How can auditory information provided by announcements of bus drivers in an autonomous shuttle bus enhance a tourists' sense of place?” 

Two auditory concepts to be tested were created and therefore two simulations with different bus driver announcements were implemented.
